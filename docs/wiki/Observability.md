# Observability

Kinetix exposes Prometheus metrics, a structured Route Trace, a bounded flight
recorder, a live in-flight view, and webhook alerts. All diagnostics are
**metadata-only** by default — never prompt/completion bodies.

## Health

`GET /healthz`:

```json
{"status":"ok","uptime_secs":3,"database":"ok","data_plane":"serving","control_plane":"ok"}
```

It stays **HTTP 200** while the data plane is serviceable. `control_plane:
degraded` means the store is unavailable but inference still works from the
in-memory snapshot, so the instance is not dropped from a load balancer.

## Runtime health

`GET /admin/api/health/runtime` requires admin auth. Its `window` query accepts
`5m`, `1h`, or `24h` (default `1h`). The response combines persisted telemetry
at provider, account, and model scope with live provider circuit states and
quota observations.

Telemetry keeps separate counters for rate limits, quota exhaustion, server
errors, connection errors, timeouts, authentication errors, target errors, and
bad requests. A quota observation becomes stale and neutral to adaptive routing
when its reset time passes. A response header explicitly reporting zero
remaining marks the account exhausted through the pool-health path.

## Metrics

`GET /admin/api/metrics` emits Prometheus text (requires admin auth):

| Metric | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `kinetix_requests_total` | Total requests. |
| `kinetix_error_rate` | Error fraction (gauge). |
| `kinetix_cost_usd_total` | Total known spend. |
| `kinetix_avg_latency_ms` / `kinetix_avg_ttft_ms` | Averages. |
| `kinetix_cached_tokens_total` / `kinetix_cache_write_tokens_total` | Cache-read / cache-write token totals. |

Cache status is derived from final normalized provider usage, not cache affinity or
a static request flag:

- `cached_tokens > 0` → `hit`
- otherwise `cache_write_tokens > 0` → `miss`
- neither observed → `bypass`

For Anthropic streaming, `message_start` normally reports cache usage before
Kinetix commits the downstream response, so `X-Kinetix-Cache` uses that
pre-commit value. Persisted request/usage records are authoritative and are
recomputed from the final usage even when a protocol cannot expose cache usage
before response commit.
| `kinetix_fallback_hops_total` / `kinetix_route_fallbacks_total` / `kinetix_route_skip_total` | Routing. |
| `kinetix_failures_pre_commit_total` / `kinetix_failures_post_commit_total` | Failures before/after the commit point. |
| `kinetix_cancellations_total` / `kinetix_cancellation_latency_ms` | Client disconnects + detection latency. |
| `kinetix_active_streams` / `kinetix_live_view_dropped_total` | Live view. |
| `kinetix_log_queue_depth` / `kinetix_log_queue_dropped_total` | Usage-log queue. |
| `kinetix_flight_recorder_requests` / `kinetix_flight_recorder_dropped_total` | Flight recorder. |
| `kinetix_account_status{status}` | Accounts by state. |
| `kinetix_control_plane_degraded` | `1` when the store is down. |
| `kinetix_usage_unknown_total` / `kinetix_usage_estimated_total` / `kinetix_usage_unknown_cost_total` | Accounting confidence. |
| `kinetix_credential_failures_total` | Credential-strategy failures. |
| `kinetix_ip_rate_limited_total` | Per-IP rejections. |
| `kinetix_allocations_total` / `kinetix_alloc_bytes_total` | Allocations per request (only when built `--features alloc-stats`; `0` otherwise = honestly "not measured"). |

## Route Trace

Every request produces a Route Trace: candidate enumeration, predicate/capability
results, skip reasons, the selected account/model (internally), attempt outcomes,
fallback causes, the commit point, and the final result.

- Retrieve by request: `GET /admin/api/requests/{id}/route-trace`.
- Retrieve by the client's opaque id: `GET /admin/api/route-traces/{krt_…}`.

Trace steps look like `resolve → candidate → skip → attempt → commit → result`
with per-step timings and warnings. Each target attempt includes its structured
`resolved_transport` value (for example, `openai-responses`) so transport and
endpoint decisions can be diagnosed without exposing credentials.

When a request evaluates plugin routing facts (`plugin.<id>.<name>`) or targets a plugin-backed provider (`wire_plugin` / `credential_plugin`), the Route Trace records:
- Evaluated fact values and their source (`plugin_id`, `plugin_version`, `capability`).
- Explicit skip reasons if a bound plugin is uninstalled, disabled, or tripping its circuit breaker.
- Credential lease acquisition or refresh steps.

## Plugin metrics and audit

Plugin performance and reliability are monitored independently of core proxy traffic:

* **Per-plugin metrics (`GET /admin/api/plugins/{id}/metrics`)**:
  * `host_invocations_total`: Total guest function invocations.
  * `host_faults_total`: Traps, panics, and internal plugin errors.
  * `host_timeouts_total`: Executions preempted by epoch interruption.
  * `host_cancellations_total`: Client disconnects during guest execution (never penalizes circuit).
  * `host_http_requests_total`: Outbound HTTP requests made through the host HTTP capability.
  * `circuit_state` & `consecutive_failures`: Current circuit-breaker status (`closed`, `open`, `half_open`).
  * `kv_bytes`: Total encrypted storage consumed by the plugin in `plugin_kv`.
* **Usage log attribution**: The `usage_logs` database table records `plugin_id` and `plugin_version` on every completed request that used a plugin, ensuring complete auditability and usage analytics.
* **Plugin audit trail (`GET /admin/api/plugins/{id}/audit`)**: Dedicated view of lifecycle actions (install, enable, disable, permission approvals/revocations, removal).

## Flight recorder

A bounded, metadata-only ring of lifecycle events (request accepted, auth
complete, upstream connect/headers/first frame, tool/reasoning event classes,
commit, cancellation, usage finalized), correlated with the request id. Retrieve
via `GET /admin/api/requests/{id}/diagnostics`. Bounded by count/bytes/time so it
can never grow unbounded.

## Live in-flight view

`GET /admin/api/requests/live` returns in-flight requests (phase
`selecting → committed → done`, commit state, fallback hops, retries, tokens,
latency, TTFT). Surfaced in the dashboard's Request Inspector and reflected in the
`kinetix_active_streams` metric.

> Client disconnects after commit are detected immediately; a disconnect during
> the pre-commit connect window is bounded only by the provider timeout (there is
> no response body to observe yet).

## Alerts

Set `KINETIX_ALERT_WEBHOOK_URL` to receive JSON webhooks (`{event: "alert"|"resolved", ...}`).
Alerts are **edge-triggered** (fire once, resolve when clear) and are control-plane
only — a webhook failure never affects inference. Covered conditions:

- high fallback rate / high error rate,
- an account unhealthy (exhausted / circuit-open / disabled),
- a Route with no healthy target,
- a key crossing 80% of its monthly budget,
- usage-log queue saturation (≥80%) or dropped rows,
- scheduled-backup failure,
- p95 added proxy latency above `KINETIX_ALERT_P95_LATENCY_MS` sustained 10 min,
- repeated credential-strategy failures.

## Logging

Operational JSON logs (stdout/journald) cover startup, config activation, upstream
errors, retries, account-state transitions, DNS destinations, control-plane
degradation, and admin actions — with secrets redacted. Prompts/completions,
virtual keys, credentials, and auth headers are **never** logged by default.
